      <p>
        I use modern web technologies to build excellent user interfaces. While
        I specialize in the frontend, I also have strong knowledge of the
        backend, having built apps using Node.js, Express and MongoDB.
      </p>
      <p>
        I enjoy learning new technologies and am continuously focused on adding
        new libraries, frameworks, languages, and design patterns to my toolbox.
        I also have plenty of experience building marketing sites for clients on
        popular CMSs, such as WordPress and Drupal.
